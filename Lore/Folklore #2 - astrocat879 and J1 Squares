astrocat879 had just started competitively coding. He started a week ago, and he now looked to solve a CCC J1 problem on DMOJ.

The problem he had stumbled upon however, was a problem that would haunt him for eternity. 

CCC '04 J1 - Squares

Gigi likes to play with squares. She has a collection of equal-sized square tiles. Gigi wants to arrange some or all of her tiles on a table to form a solid square. What is the side length of the largest possible square that Gigi can build?

For example, when Gigi has 9 tiles she can use them all to build a square whose side length is 3. But when she has only 8 tiles, the largest square that she can build has side length 2.

Write a program that inputs the number of tiles and then prints out the maximum side length. You may assume that the number of tiles is less than ten thousand.

"Heh, this should be easy" he said.

He later got a discord message from his "senpai" N3RDSLQYER84:

Git Gud!!!!111 it said

He chuckled as he submitted his 12 lines of clear and consise code

AC.. AC.. AC.. 

Heh another problem solved

WA

AC

His jaw dropped

Such a simple problem, yet he had failed it.

A junior 1 problem, he had failed

His streak was broken

and so was his heart
 
he later realized that he had forgot something

something so small, yet so essential

-0.5.

AC.. AC.. AC.. AC.. AC

His mind was blown
How could he have forgotten that?
How will senpai N3RDSLQYER84 react??
However he later realized, that this mistake was in his past and that he would learn from it to become the ultimate coder in the future.

To this day, many coders reflect upon his mistake, and hope to learn from it.
